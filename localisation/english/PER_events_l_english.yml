 PER_hijab.1.t: "The Veil Debate"
 PER_hijab.1.d: "For centuries, the veil has been part of our cultural and religious fabric. But as Iran marches toward modernity, the role of hijab in public life is being fiercely debated. Reformists call for complete removal, traditionalists demand full enforcement, and moderates seek a middle ground. The decision we make today will shape the soul of our nation — are we to embrace modern ideals, preserve tradition, or find balance?"

 PER_hijab.1.a: "Ban the Hijab – We must modernize at all costs."
 PER_hijab.1.b: "Make Hijab Optional – Let the people choose."
 PER_hijab.1.c: "Mandate Hijab – Respect our heritage and tradition."
